📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the submission for Task 2 of the Web Development Internship at Elevate Labs. The objective was to create a visually structured profile page by implementing core CSS concepts, specifically focusing on the CSS Box Model.




🛠️ Tools Used

Primary Editor: VS Code.



Debugging: Browser DevTools for inspecting elements and live-tweaking layouts.


🚀 Implementation Details
To complete this task, the following technical requirements were met:


External Styling: Created a separate style.css file and linked it properly using the <link> tag within the HTML <head> section.


Global Styling: Applied consistent font families, background colors, and text colors to the body to establish a clean visual theme.


CSS Box Model: Effectively used margin, border, padding, and content to create professional spacing between elements.



Visual Hierarchy: Styled headers, paragraphs, and lists differently to improve the readability and structure of the profile.


Scalable Practices: Implemented class-based styling instead of inline styles to ensure the code is maintainable and scalable.


Code Refactoring: Minimized repetition by refactoring styles into reusable CSS classes.

📂 Deliverables
A visually structured profile page with proper spacing.

Demonstrated implementation of the CSS Box Model.
